            <p>
                Below are the various steps of the software departments hiring process for developers.
                Things are different for non-developer yet technical positions such as User Experience expert and for
                non-technical positions such as Product Manager and Community Manager.

                        <p>
                            Easy questions and programming exercises that get graded automatically.
                            Typically this takes a bit under an hour to complete.

                        <p>
                            We use HackerRank to avoid spam applications and establish
                            a minimum level of technical ability and willingness to spend time in our hiring process.

                        <p>
                            30 minute call where we’ll get to know each other and to see what
                            values we both share. It’s a two way conversation, and we want to
                            understand if we may be a good fit for each other.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Pair Programming Session</h2>
                        <p>
                            This session lasts 90 minutes and allows us to get a better understanding
                            of your technical skills and how you collaborate. It is done remotely
                            over Google Hangout with one or two of our developers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first part of the session is a pair programming exercise which lasts
                            about 55 minutes. You'll be working together with one of the developers
                            on refactoring a small set of self contained legacy code. No knowledge of
                            MediaWiki or other such specific technology is required. You will have the
                            choice between doing the exercise in PHP and in JS.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Pair Programming allows us to see how you approach problems, how
                            you collaborate and how you communicate. You and the developer will
                            pretend to work, as colleagues, on a task at a company you just started
                            working for. This collaboration is what is evaluated, so there is no need
                            to rush and try to get as much of the exercise done as possible. If
                            it is not completed, which is likely, you will not be penalized for this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The remote pairing is done via <a href="https://floobits.com/">Floobits</a>,
                            a service that allows synchronization of code between different machines and editors.
                            If you are using one of the <a href="https://floobits.com/help/plugins">supported
                            editors</a>,
                            you can just install the Floobits plugin for it. If none of these editors works for you,
                            it is possible to use the web based editor. For the web based editor, you also set up
                            <a href="https://floobits.com/help/floomatic">synchronization of the files to your
                                device</a>,
                            since otherwise you will not be able to execute the program and tests.
                            The developer is likely to use PhpStorm (IntelliJ) as editor.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To prepare for the session, create a Floobits account and set up and test the integration
                            with your editor of choice. To do this test you can create your own Floobits workspace and
                            connect to it. Also make sure that your Google Hangout is working and that you are able
                            to execute in the language you choose for the exercise.
                        </p>

                        <p>Before the second part of the session you can take a short break if you want.</p>

                        <p>
                            The second part of the session is a 25 minute segment in which you will be asked
                            a number of broad technical questions and in which we will talk about
                            your motivation, your learning habits, your goals and your expectations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the end of the session there is some time to ask extra questions about whatever
                            you are curious about, such as the structure of our teams, the agile process we
                            use, or the technologies used for a given project.

                        <h2 id="InsightDay">Insight Day</h2>
                        <p>
                            A half-day during which you visit our office in Berlin.
                            For people living abroad we might choose to pay their travel costs,
                            or we might choose to do the Insight Day remotely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You will be given a tour through the office and briefly meet
                            with people that have various roles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You will also spend some
                            time with one or more of the developers you would be working with
                            by sitting next to them as they walk you through something they
                            are working on. This allows you to get to know your potential
                            colleagues and potential codebase, ask questions and discuss
                            things as you see fit, as well as giving these colleagues a chance
                            to get to know you.

                        <p>
                            A final non-technical interview with our head of department.

                        <p>
                            We send you the job offer based on the details agreed upon in the
                            Final Interview.

                We try to move things along as quickly as possible, though likely need several days,
                up to a week, in between the steps up to, and including, the Insight Day, to schedule
                sessions. So you can expect that going though the whole process will take about 4 weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may skip the HackerRank and/or Telephone Interview steps for candidates already familiar to us.
